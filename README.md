SexyDates
=========

SexyDates is an Objective-C category on NSNumber that allows you to create dates (NSDate objects) in a sexy, Rails-/ActiveSupport-like way: `@(3).days.ago`.

Installation
------------
Just add the two files `NSNumber+SexyDates.h` and `NSNumber+SexyDates` to your project and you're ready to go!

Usage examples
--------------
Sexy version:
```objc
@(1).minute.fromNow // In a minute
@(3).days.ago // Three days ago
[@(4).weeks since:@(1).day.fromNow] // Tomorrow in 4 weeks
[@(2).years until:@(1).day.ago] // Yesterday two years ago
```

Long version:
```objc
[[@(1) minute] fromNow] // In a minute
[[@(4) weeks] since:[[@(1) day] fromNow]] // Tomorrow in 4 weeks
```

Longest version:
```objc
[[[NSNumber numberWithInteger:1] minute] fromNow] // In a minute
```


You get the ideaâ€¦
